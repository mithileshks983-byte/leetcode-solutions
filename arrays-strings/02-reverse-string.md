## Problem: Reverse a String (Easy)
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

### Approach
I used a two-pointer approach, placing one pointer at the start and one at the end of the string array. I swapped the characters at these pointers and moved them toward the center until they met.

### Complexity
- Time: $O(N)$
- Space: $O(1)$

### Notes
Modifying the array in-place is highly memory efficient since it doesn't require allocating a new array.
